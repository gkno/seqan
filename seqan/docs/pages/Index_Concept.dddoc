..description:
Concepts are the 'interfaces' in generic programming.
They are not formulated as C++ constructs, but they are implemented by C++ classes.
A concept is defined by a set of functions and metafunctions, 
and a class implements a concept if it implements the functions and metafunctions of this concept.

...note:The list of concepts is not complete yet. Completing it is ongoing work.
