Building Breakpoint Calculator
==============================

Breakpoint Calculator requires the LEMON library.  You can get a copy from

    http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon

If you do not install LEMON in a "standard" location (e.g. "/usr" on Unix or
"C:\Program Files\LEMON") then you have to set LEMON_ROOT_DIR when calling
CMake.

For example, if you have installed LEMON in $HOME/local/LEMON, then you would
use the following commands to build the program on Unix in Release mode:

    svn co https://svn.mi.fu-berlin.de/seqan/trunk/seqan seqan-trunk
    mkdir -p seqan-trunk-build/Release
    cd seqan-trunk-build/Release
    cmake ../../seqan-trunk -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLEMON_ROOT_DIR=$HOME/local/LEMON
    make breakpoint_calculator
