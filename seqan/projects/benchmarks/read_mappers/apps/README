Read Mapper Benchmark Apps -- README
====================================

General Notes: Intervals
------------------------

There are two kinds of intervals used in the read mapper benchmark:
Half-open and closed intervals.

The names of the borders of half open intervals are named begin and
end.  The half-open integer interval [begin, end) contains all
integers from, and including, begin up to, but excluding end.  This is
mostly used for infixes, e.g. when specifying where a read maps to a
contig.

The borders of half open intervals are named first and last.  The
closed interval [first, last] contains all integers from, and
including first, up to, and including, last.


General Notes: Logging, stdout, stderr
--------------------------------------

Generally, output is written to stdout.  Log messages are written to
stderr.  In some cases, the log messages are meant for users and it is
just printed in no special form.

In some cases, the log output is meant for further analysis.  In this
case, it consists of the prefix "log> " and is followed by a log
record, formatted as a JSON object (see http://json.org).  JSON
objects have the property to be easily parseable by programs (there
are libraries for every conceivable programming language) but still
readable by users.

Log records always contain the "type" field which stores the type of
the log message.  There can be an arbitrary number of other entries,
depending on the log message type.
