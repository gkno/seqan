RM Benchmark Test Fixtures
==========================

Each of the fixtures 1-7 consists of the reference sequences, the
reads sequences, the "golden" results of RazerS on these results and
the expected result of the target interval generator.

The files are named as follows:

  <num>_seq.fasta    The contig sequences.
  <num>_reads.fasta  The reads.
  <num>_golden.sam   The "golden" result of RazerS.
  <num>_result.wit   The expected output of wit_builder.
  <num>_result.json  The expected output of compare_sam_wit.

  01     -id -i 100           One contig 20C20G20A20T, reads 20{C,G,A,T},
                              no errors, with indels.
  02     -id -i 95            Same as 01 but 1 error (read len = 20).
  03     -id -i 100           Two contigs 20C20A and 20G20T, two reads
                              20A and 20C, no errors, with indels.
  05     -id -i 100           Data from saccharmyces cerevisige.
  06     -id -i 91.9849241194 Same as 05, but with up to 2 errors on average.
  07     -id -i 95.9924620597 Same as 05, but with up to 1 errors on average.

  09     -i 100               01 without indels
  10     -i 95                02 without indels
