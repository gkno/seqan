RABEMA - Read Alignment BEnchMArk
=================================

Rabema is a program that supports a new read mapper benchmark methodology. The
methodology is based on a strict definition of the read mapping problem and
allows the evaluation of arbitrary read mapping programs that create SAM
output.

The paper gives an explanation of the theory behind the benchmark methodology
with an example evaluatio

Gold Standard File Format (WIT)
===============================

Version: 1.0

The gold standard is built for either Hamming or Levenshtein distance, a given
error rate (in percent), a reference sequence, a read set and the result of a
fully sensitive read mapper (e.g. RazerS).

The first 5 lines of a WIT file might look like this:

    @WIT	VN:1.0
    @MATES	SEP:/	TYPE:01
    # QNAME	SCORE	RNAME	RDIR	SPOS	EPOS
    SRR026674.2489878	3	2L	F	7344392	7344398	
    SRR026674.2489878	3	2L	F	10948011	10948047	

The format consists of (1) the header and (2) the intervals section with
arbitrary comment lines interleaved.

Comments
--------

Comment lines start with '#' and are ignored.

Header
------

Header lines start with '@' and are similar to SAM headers. Each header line
contains one record. Each record starts with '@', followed by the record
identifier. Then, separated by tabs, record fields follow.

There are the following records/fields.

@WIT

This records starts the header and must be the first record in the header,
there can be only one such record. The only field is the version (VN) field
that gives the version of the file format.

@MATES

This record must be present exactly once. It describes how mate pairs are
stored. Its fields are the separator of mate order identifiers (SEP) and the
type of mate order identifiers (TYPE). Valid values for the type are '01' and
'12'.

Read identifiers for mate-pairs generally look like the following:

    <mate identifier> + <separator> + <mate order identifier>

The mate identifier uniquely identifies a mate pair / fragment. The separator
usually is '.', '_', or '/'. The mate order identifier gives the number of the
read within the mate pair / fragment. Rabema uses this information to convert
names of paired-end reads within the WIT file into their mate pair names.

Examples for such mate pairs are:

    SRR026674.2489878/0 and SRR026674.2489878/1
    SRR026674.2489878_1 and SRR026674.2489878_2
