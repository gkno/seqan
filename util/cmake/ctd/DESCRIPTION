SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures 
for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data. Our library 
applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, 
extensibility, and integration with other libraries. SeqAn is easy to use and 
simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of 
performance.
