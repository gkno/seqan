Description: Re-implementation of the seeds module.
 Everything seeds: Local/global chaining, seed extension, ...
 .
 This module contains seed-related code.  The seed set class allows the
 efficient management of seeds and local chaining.  Furthermore, the module
 contains code for global, 2-dimensional chaining and gapped as well as ungapped
 X-drop seed extension. Recently, a new banded chain alignment algorithm was 
 added to the module, such that a global alignment can be computed between large
 genomic sequences given a monotonic non-decreasing chain of seeds.
 .
 This module will eventually be renamed to seeds and replace the old module.
