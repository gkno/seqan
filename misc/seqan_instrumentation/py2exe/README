This py2exe copy creates a windows application that wraps
Python 2.7 + the SeqAn Usability Analyzer Data Collection.

To create a fresh exe you need to do the following steps:
1) Install Python 2.7.3 to the default path
2) Install CMake
3) Install py2exe to the default path
4) Run setup.bat
5) TEST!

Very important:
The used module "requests" has support for IDNA.
Python's IDNA implementation itself has a dependency to the
stringprep lib.

If you included encodings.idna and you run the created windows binary you 
get the following error:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Prepare SeqAn Usability Analyzer data collection...
Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn't know how to solve this problem.
In modely.py line 349 the IDNA-needing call can be found.
I removed the line:
        netloc = netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8')
        
Since I don't need IDNA (international dns names) support I just removed the
additional encoding.

SO IF YOU EVER UPDATE THE "REQUESTS" MODULE
PLEASE SOLVE THE ISSUE OR RE-APPLY THE ABOVE MENTIONED CHANGE.
